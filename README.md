## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fanno, and I'm an aspiring software developer.

I've always been interested in tech - some of my earliest memories come from playing with PC spare parts in my grandpa's house.
My uncle worked as a repair technician, and often brought home parts that were going to be disposed of/recycled: CPUs, motherboards, hard drives, cases, mice, keyboards, etc.,
and so there was a closet PACKED with random stuff.

The first machine I built was for playing [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)); but learning about the hardware and fitting parts together was incredibly interesting itself, and I've been having fun with computers ever since!

I've picked up some Javascript and make use of Node, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, React, and more.

When I'm not getting lost learning something new or looking for web applications to [self-host](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted), I'm playing videogames, hiking, disc golfing, fishing, or trying some other new hobby.
